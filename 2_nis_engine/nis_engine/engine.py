"""A useq-schema acquisition engine for NIS-Elements.

``NisEngine`` implements the engine interface of pymmcore-plus (``PMDAEngine``),
so the pymmcore-plus runner can execute useq sequences (the classic
``useq.MDASequence`` and the new ``useq.v2.MDASequence``) on a Nikon microscope
and hand the images to any of its writers or viewers.

Before anything moves, every event and the sequence's plans are checked in
``checks.py``, which also says what an event may hold on the Nikon. During the
run, a focus action shifts later Z moves at the same position by the distance
it moved. ``keep_shutter_open`` is ignored (NIS handles the shutter), and
waiting for ``min_start_time`` is the runner's job.

The bridge and this engine must run on the same computer: each image travels
as a temporary TIFF file.
