"""A useq-schema acquisition engine for NIS-Elements.

``NisEngine`` implements the engine interface of pymmcore-plus (``PMDAEngine``),
so the pymmcore-plus runner can execute useq sequences (the classic
``useq.MDASequence`` and the new ``useq.v2.MDASequence``) on a Nikon microscope
and hand the images to any of its writers or viewers.

What each event field does here:

- ``x_pos``, ``y_pos``, ``z_pos``: absolute NIS stage position in um; None = stay.
- ``channel.config``: the name of a NIS optical configuration (``group`` is ignored).
- ``exposure``: camera exposure in ms.
- ``properties``: ``("Nosepiece", "Position", n)`` turns the nosepiece to slot n
  (1, 2, ...); ``("PFS", "State", "On")`` or ``"Off"`` switches the Perfect Focus System.
- ``action``: ``AcquireImage`` snaps one image. ``HardwareAutofocus`` locks focus
  with the PFS, then switches it off.
  ``CustomAction(name="autofocus", data={"range_um": 50, "speed": 30})`` runs the
  NIS image-based focus sweep. A focus action shifts later Z moves at the same
  position by the distance it moved.

Anything else (camera ROI, SLM images, other custom actions) is refused before
the run starts. ``keep_shutter_open`` is ignored; NIS handles the shutter.
Waiting for ``min_start_time`` is the runner's job.

The bridge and this engine must run on the same computer: each image travels
as a temporary TIFF file.
