"""The eyes: the vision model's own conversation for the session.

Every image the assistant looks at is a turn in this conversation, with the
time it was taken, the microscope's settings and the measured numbers, so the
eyes can compare the current image with earlier ones ("is it sharper than
before?", "has the sample moved since the first image?") and can be asked
about the images seen without taking a new one. The chat model itself never
carries an image; it gets the eyes' answer in words.

The newest VISION_FRAMES_KEPT images stay attached; older turns keep their
text (time, settings, numbers, and what the eyes said) and lose the picture.
Beyond VISION_TURNS_KEPT looks the oldest turns are dropped altogether, so the
cost of a look stays about one image however long the session runs.
