"""Serve a model file on this computer, so the assistant works without the internet.

A ``.gguf`` model file chosen in the window is served by llama.cpp's
OpenAI-compatible server (the ``llama_cpp.server`` module of the
``llama-cpp-python`` package) as a child process that only listens on this
computer. The assistant then talks to it exactly as it would to any other
OpenAI-style server, so nothing in the agent depends on the runtime. The child
lives while that model is in use: choosing another model or closing the window
stops it.

Install the runtime with ``pip install "llama-cpp-python[server]"`` (a build
with GPU support is much faster; see that package's documentation). Model files
come from Hugging Face, for example a Gemma or Qwen ``.gguf``; put them in the
models folder shown in the window. A model can also see images when a matching
projector file (its name contains ``mmproj``) sits next to it.
