"""What the assistant can plan, and how a plan becomes a useq sequence.

``AcquisitionPlan`` is the flat form the model fills in (positions, channels,
a Z-stack, tiles, time points). ``plan_to_sequence`` turns it into a classic
``useq.MDASequence``, and ``describe`` puts a sequence into plain sentences for
the operator.
