"""Schedules: an instruction carried out later, as if the operator typed it then.

"Look every three minutes", "in ten minutes start the plan", "at 15:00 switch
the PFS off": the assistant's ``schedule`` tool adds a named schedule here, and
the chat window's clock asks ``pop_due`` every second and sends each due
instruction as an ordinary turn, marked as scheduled in the transcript. So a
scheduled action goes through the same tools, checks and refusals as anything
typed, one at a time and never while a turn is running. The model cannot keep
time; this does, and the microscope state carries the clock and the schedules
so the model knows both.

Two threads use it at once: the assistant's tools add and cancel schedules,
and the window's clock pops the due one. A lock makes every change whole, so
neither thread ever sees a half-changed list.

A scheduled turn is not the operator's: a scheduled acquisition or long stage
move still asks for their go-ahead in the chat, and waits until they answer.
