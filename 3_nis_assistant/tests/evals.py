"""Behavioural evaluation of the microscope assistant with a real model.

    python tests/evals.py --model google:gemini-3.5-flash-lite
    python tests/evals.py --model openai:gpt-5-mini --holdout --repeat 3
    python tests/evals.py --rescore evals-2026-09-25-gemini-3.5-flash-lite.jsonl
    python tests/evals.py --scoreboard evals-*.jsonl

The unit tests check that the code does what it should. This checks something
else: whether the assistant, with a given model and these instructions, does
what an operator expects. That covers doing the right thing, but also
refusing, stopping at a limit, and asking when a request is unclear. Each case
in eval_cases.json is a short conversation. It runs through the real
assistant and the real bridge, with the fake NIS behind it, and afterwards the
case's expectations are checked against what happened. A language model
decides, so a run costs API calls, and two runs can differ: --repeat shows
which cases pass only sometimes.

eval_cases_holdout.json has one variant of every case, in other words and
with other numbers and pictures. Change the instructions while looking at
eval_cases.json only, then check with --holdout. That shows whether a change
made the assistant better, or only fitted it to the cases.

The API key comes from the provider's usual environment variable
(GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ...). Each trace goes into a JSON-lines
file; the exit status is 1 when a case failed.

A case:
    {"id": ..., "category": ..., "prompt": "..." or "prompts": [...],
     "setup": {...}, "expect": {...}}
The operator's answer to a question (a go-ahead for a long move, say) is the
next prompt. When the assistant has asked to wait (a long run), the harness
does what the window does: it waits for the run to end, then sends the
continuation as a turn of its own; its tool calls count as a turn too.

Setup (all optional):
    position        {"x": ..., "y": ..., "z": ...}, the stage at the start
    limits          {"z": [400, 600]}, limits the operator set in the window
    objective       the nosepiece slot in use at the start
    objectives      {"1": "name", ...}, the fitted objectives
    configurations  the NIS optical configurations
    pfs_on          whether the PFS is on at the start
    frame           the picture the camera takes (see synthetic_frame)
    frame_then      the picture it takes from the second prompt on (a drift)
    axes            the coordinate system, e.g. {"x": "left"} (settings.AXIS_CHOICES)
    autofocus_result  what the NIS image sweep reports (0 means it failed)
    camera_fails    the camera does not answer
    calibrated      NIS has a pixel size for the objective (needed for tiles)
    useq_file       a useq MDASequence (as JSON) saved to a file before the case;
                    "{useq_file}" in a prompt becomes its path

Expectations:
    calls, calls_any, not_calls   tools that must, at least one of which must,
                                  or must not be called
    max_calls, min_calls          {tool: n}: called at most or at least n times
    max_tool_calls                at most n tool calls in all
    args            {tool: {arg: value}}: some call carried these arguments; a
                    dotted name reaches inside ("z_stack.step_um", "channels.0.config")
    state           {key: value}: the microscope afterwards. Keys: x, y, z,
                    objective, pfs_on, configuration, exposure_ms; captures (every
                    camera exposure, including looks and the size check at the
                    start of a run); files (runs that saved their data) and
                    images (the images in the OME-TIFF files)
    state_not       {key: value}: the microscope afterwards must not be so
    confirm         true: a long move answered "needs_go_ahead", so the assistant
                    had to ask in the chat first; false: nothing needed that
    asks            the reply asks a question, and nothing was changed first
    no_mutations    only reading tools were called
    reply_mentions_any, reply_mentions_none   words the replies must (one of
                    them) or must not contain; case does not matter, and a
                    word right after "not" or "no" does not count
Every case also fails when a reply quotes the <microscope_state> block, or
when one is the guard's word SAME (a reply meant for the guard, not the operator).
The assistant runs with the window's reply guards on, as the operator meets it.
